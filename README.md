# Welcome to the Kotlin Algorithm Club!

Here you can find the most common algorithm and data structure implementations written in Kotlin.

The goal of this project is to showcase the most eloquent implementation; if you want to learn algorithms perhaps it is a wrong place. I do full-heartedly recommend [The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693) and...
 
## [Algorithms, 4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

This project is inspired by and based on wonderful works of [Robert Sedgewick](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) and [Kevin Wayne](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/contact/). Most of the implementations were taken from the [algs4](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4) library.
