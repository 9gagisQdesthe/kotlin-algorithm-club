# Welcome to the Kotlin Algorithm Club!

Here you can find the most common algorithms and data structures written in Kotlin.

The goal of this project is to create the most eloquent implementations of old algorithms in the new language. The code is meant to be as self-describing as possible, so I do not plan to include much documentation. It is assumed that you know the basics; if you want to learn algorithms perhaps it is a wrong place. I do full-heartedly recommend [The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693) and of course...
 
## [Algorithms, 4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

This project is inspired by and based on wonderful works of [Robert Sedgewick](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) and [Kevin Wayne](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/contact/). Most of the implementations were taken from the [algs4](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4) library.
